# Welcome to my raspberry pico repo
Here contains the various files I use for my pico projects

I have a few dependancies. 

For the micropython files i am using the Pimoroni-pico-uf2 v0.2.1
Which can be found here: https://github.com/pimoroni/pimoroni-pico/releases/tag/v0.2.1

The Pimoroni libraries I use are found on: https://github.com/pimoroni/pimoroni-pico/tree/main/micropython


For circuitpython i am using adafruit-circuitpython-raspberry_pi_pico-en_US-6.2.0

Found on: https://circuitpython.org/board/raspberry_pi_pico/

Along with circuit python libaries from adafruit:
https://circuitpython.org/libraries

Sometimes I encountered errors and i needed to download an adafruit flash_nuke.uf2 file which wiped the pico clean.
